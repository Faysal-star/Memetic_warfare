## PHASE 3: COMPETITIVE MODE (October 31, 2025)

### Completed Tasks

#### 1. Enhanced Path Cost Breakdown UI ✅
**Problem**: User requested to show final optimized path separately with calculations
**Solution**: 
- Added blue-highlighted section showing only the final path nodes
- Each connection displays its detailed calculation
- All explored paths moved to collapsible section
- Improved visual hierarchy and readability

**Files Modified**:
- `src/components/AStarVisualizer.tsx` - Enhanced path breakdown display

#### 2. Game State Schema ✅
**Task**: Create data structures for competitive gameplay
**Implementation**:
- `GameState`: Network state, infected/resistant nodes, turn management
- `GameMove`: Move history with success tracking
- `GameEvent`: Event logging system
- `GameConfig`: Configurable game parameters

**Files Created**:
- `src/schemas/game-state.ts` - Complete game state definitions

#### 3. Game Engine ✅
**Task**: Implement core game mechanics
**Implementation**:
- `initializeGame()`: Setup game with network and meme
- `mutateMeme()`: AI can mutate memes to increase acceptance (per The_plan.md)
  - Increases virality, emotional intensity
  - Adjusts political bias towards target
  - Simplifies complexity for broader appeal
  - Reduces factual accuracy slightly
- `executeAttackerMove()`: Handle infection and mutation moves
- `executeDefenderMove()`: Handle fact-checking and inoculation
- `checkWinCondition()`: Determine game outcome
- `getPossibleMoves()`: Generate valid moves for AI

**Meme Mutation Details**:
```typescript
// Adjusts attributes to better match target
- Political bias: Moves 30% towards target's political leaning
- Emotional intensity: +15% (max 1.0)
- Virality factor: +15% (max 1.0)
- Complexity: -15% (simpler = more viral)
- Factual accuracy: -7.5% (trade-off for virality)
- Source credibility: +7.5% (appears more legitimate)
```

**Files Created**:
- `src/algorithms/game-engine.ts` - Core game logic (242 lines)

#### 4. AI Strategies ✅
**Task**: Implement attacker and defender AI algorithms
**Implementation**:

**Attacker Strategies**:
- `greedy_degree`: Target high-degree nodes (hubs) - maximizes potential spread
- `high_susceptibility`: Target most emotionally susceptible nodes - highest success rate
- `bridge_targeting`: Target nodes connecting different communities - cross-group spread

**Defender Strategies**:
- `reactive`: Fact-check and inoculate highest-threat nodes - responds to infections
- `proactive`: Preemptively inoculate high-degree nodes - prevents spread
- `bridge_protection`: Protect inter-community bridges - contains spread

**Strategy Selection**:
- AI automatically selects moves based on chosen strategy
- Each strategy evaluates all possible moves and selects the best
- Strategies consider node attributes, network topology, and acceptance probability

**Files Created**:
- `src/algorithms/ai-strategies.ts` - AI decision-making logic (244 lines)

#### 5. Competitive Mode UI ✅
**Task**: Create visualization for AI vs AI gameplay
**Implementation**:
- **Left Panel** (25%): Game controls, status, budgets, win conditions
  - Turn counter and current player indicator
  - Infection rate tracking
  - Attacker/Defender budget display
  - Play/Pause/Step/Reset controls

- Automatic game over detection

**Files Created**:
- `src/components/CompetitiveMode.tsx` - Complete competitive mode UI (254 lines)

#### 6. Main Page Integration ✅
**Task**: Add mode switcher between A* and Competitive modes
**Implementation**:
- Tab-based navigation with icons (Target for A*, Swords for Competitive)
- Seamless switching between modes
- Both modes use same network/meme configuration
- Shared network generation controls
- Mode selection persists during session

**Files Modified**:
- `app/page.tsx` - Added tabs for mode switching

## RECENT FIXES (Latest Session)

### UI Layout Improvements ✅
**Problem**: Competitive mode had 3 panels (control, network, event log), right panel was too cramped
**Solution**: Changed to 4-panel layout
- **Left Panel (col-span-2)**: Game controls and strategy selection
- **Middle Panel (col-span-6)**: Network visualization (50% width)
- **Right Panel (col-span-2)**: Node information on hover
- **Far Right Panel (col-span-2)**: Event log

**Result**: Better space distribution, node info and event log are side-by-side

### Real-Time Visualization Fixes ✅
**Problem**: 
1. When attacker attacks a node, no visual indication
2. Defender moves not visually distinct
3. Infected/resistant colors not updating in real-time during simulation

**Solution**:
1. Added `lastMoveNodeId` state to track current move
2. Modified `NetworkVisualizer` to accept `competitiveMode` prop with:
   - `infectedNodes`: Set of infected node IDs
   - `resistantNodes`: Set of resistant node IDs
   - `lastMoveNodeId`: Currently targeted node
   - `currentPlayer`: 'attacker' or 'defender'
3. Updated node rendering logic:
   - **Infected nodes**: Red (#EF4444)
   - **Resistant nodes**: Green (#22C55E)
   - **Susceptible nodes**: Gray (#9CA3AF)
   - **Attacker's target**: Thick dark red border (#DC2626)
   - **Defender's target**: Thick dark green border (#16A34A)
4. Border highlights persist for 1.5 seconds after move

**Result**: Clear visual feedback for every move, real-time color updates, distinct attacker/defender highlights

**Files Modified**:
- `src/components/CompetitiveMode.tsx`: Added lastMoveNodeId tracking, 4-panel layout
- `src/components/NetworkVisualizer.tsx`: Added competitiveMode prop, updated node rendering

## KEY FEATURES IMPLEMENTED

### Competitive Mode Gameplay
1. **Turn-Based AI Combat**: Attacker tries to spread misinformation, Defender tries to contain it
2. **Meme Mutation**: Attacker can mutate memes to increase acceptance probability
   - Adjusts political bias towards target (30% movement)
   - Increases emotional intensity (+15%) and virality (+15%)
   - Reduces complexity (-15%) for broader appeal
   - Slight accuracy decrease (-7.5%) for virality boost
3. **Multiple AI Strategies**: 3 attacker × 3 defender = 9 different matchups
4. **Real-Time Visualization**: Watch the network change as AI agents make decisions
5. **Event Logging**: Complete history of all moves and their outcomes
6. **Win Conditions**: 
   - Attacker wins at 60% infection rate
   - Defender wins by keeping infection below threshold for 20 turns
   - Defender wins if attacker runs out of budget

### A* Pathfinding Mode
1. **Two Trust Modes**: 
   - Social Trust: Based purely on personal relationships
   - Meme Trust: Incorporates meme attributes and acceptance probability
2. **Step-by-Step Visualization**: Watch A* explore the network
3. **Detailed Cost Breakdown**: 
   - Final optimized path shown prominently in blue highlight
   - Each edge shows complete calculation details
   - All explored paths available in collapsible section
