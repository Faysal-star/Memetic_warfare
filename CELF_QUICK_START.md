3. **Run Comparison**
   - Click **"Run Comparison"** button in the Strategy Comparison tab
   - Wait 10-30 seconds (this runs actual simulations!)
   - Progress indicator will show

4. **Analyze Results**

   **Metric Cards (Top)**:
   - üü¢ **Best Infection Rate**: Highest spread achieved
   - üîµ **Fastest Strategy**: Quickest computation

   **Charts**:
   - **Performance Comparison**: Bar chart showing metrics
   - **Infection Progression**: Line chart showing growth over time
   - **Statistics Table**: Detailed numbers with standard deviation

   **Key Insights**:
   - üìà CELF effectiveness vs. baseline
   - ‚ö° CELF++ speedup analysis
   - üéØ Meme-type considerations

5. **Switch Metrics**
   - Click **Infection Rate** / **Computation Time** / **Win Rate**
   - Bar chart updates to show selected metric

6. **Export Results**
   - Click **"Export"** to download benchmark data

### Strategies Compared

1. **Greedy Degree**: Select highest-degree nodes
2. **High Susceptibility**: Target most susceptible individuals
3. **Bridge Targeting**: Focus on network bridges
4. **CELF**: Submodular optimization with lazy evaluation
5. **CELF++**: Optimized CELF with look-ahead caching

## Understanding the Results

### Why CELF/CELF++ Outperforms

**Better Seed Selection**:
- Uses influence spread estimation (not just degree)
- Accounts for network structure
- Considers diminishing returns (submodularity)
- Plans multiple steps ahead

**Example Results** (typical):
```
Strategy              Infection    Time      Win Rate
---------------------------------------------------
CELF++                58.0%       2.8s      80%
CELF                  58.0%       5.2s      80%
High Susceptibility   52.0%       1.8s      70%
Bridge Targeting      48.0%       1.5s      65%
Greedy Degree         45.0%       1.2s      60%
```

**Key Insight**: CELF++ achieves same quality as CELF but ~46% faster!

## Configuration Tips

### For Faster Computation
- Use smaller networks (20-30 nodes)
- Reduce budget (3-5 seeds)
- Fewer trials in comparison (1-2 instead of 3)

### For More Accuracy
- Larger networks (50-100 nodes)
- More trials (5-10)
- Higher budget (allows more strategy variation)

### For Best Visualization
- Medium networks (30-50 nodes)
- Moderate budget (5 seeds)
- Step-through mode (manual control)

## Common Questions

### Q: Why does "Compute Seeds" take time?
**A**: CELF++ runs Monte Carlo simulations (100-1000) to estimate influence spread for each potential seed. This is computationally intensive but ensures optimal selection.

### Q: Why do results vary between runs?
**A**: The propagation is stochastic (probabilistic). Each run simulates random activation based on acceptance probabilities. Run multiple trials for statistical significance.

### Q: What's the difference between CELF and CELF++?
**A**:
- **CELF**: Original lazy evaluation algorithm
- **CELF++**: Adds look-ahead optimization and caches marginal gains
- **Result**: Same quality, much faster (~40-60% speedup)

### Q: Which meme type spreads fastest?
**A**:
- **Political Conspiracy**: High virality, low accuracy ‚Üí spreads fast
- **Health Misinformation**: Medium virality ‚Üí moderate spread
- **Factual News**: Low virality, high accuracy ‚Üí spreads slowly

Critical thinkers resist low-accuracy memes!

### Q: Can I use this for my research?
**A**: Yes! Export the data and cite the original CELF/CELF++ papers:
- Leskovec et al. (2007) - CELF
- Goyal et al. (2011) - CELF++

## Troubleshooting

### Page Not Loading
- Check if dev server is running: `npm run dev`
- Try `http://localhost:3001` if 3000 is in use
- Clear browser cache and reload

### Slow Performance
- **Normal**: First computation always slower (cold start)
- **Solution**: Use smaller networks or reduce simulations
- **Future**: Will add web workers for background computation

### Build Errors
- Run: `npm install` to ensure dependencies
- Run: `npm run build` to check for errors
- All TypeScript errors should be fixed

### UI Not Responding
- Computation is synchronous (blocks UI temporarily)
- This is expected during "Compute Seeds" and "Run Comparison"
- Future improvement: Add loading indicators
